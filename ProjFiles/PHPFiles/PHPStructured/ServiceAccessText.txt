First called service is ReceiveService.php
Here we get the service method and data if this is post service
Then this data is transfered to ServiceController.php
From here as per the method requested the values are transfered to UserService.php
Here database connection isobtained from ConnectionService.php and Obtained data with sql query(generated) is executed
and obtained response is returned to the called services.
